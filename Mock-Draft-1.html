    <h3 class="draft-analysis">1.01 Griddy Merchant</h3>
      <h4 class="draft-pick">Bijan Robinson</h4>
        <p>The Griddy Merchant comes into the draft with a clear need at the
          running back position. So as chalk as the 1.01 is this year, this is
          a perfect fit for Bijan. The Merchant has been known for trading back
          in previous drafts, but wuth the hype behind Bijan at this point I
          don't see him even considering it. Bijan will join Najee as the top-2
          RB's for the Merchant and he will see Calvin Ridley return to help
          bolster an already solid WR core so after winning the 1.01 in 2023 the
          Merchant could be knocking on the door of the playoffs come 2024.
          Let's move on to some more chalk picks unfortuantely.</p>

    <h3 class="draft-analysis">1.02 2027 Fantasy Champion</h3>
      <h4 class="draft-pick">Bryce Young</h4>
        <p>Houston Homerism? No! That could never be Mason! Even if there is a
        little, Bryce Young is most likely the 1.01 in the NFL draft so he slots
        in here easily as the 1.02 especially with Super-Flex coming up soon.
         Adding Bryce Young to Joe Burrow and Geno Smith will give the 2027
         Fantasy Champ a strong core of three QB's heading into the new format
         of the league. The 2027 Fantasy Champ will still have a few holes to
         fill but with three more first round picks in store, the future is
         bright and 2027 is undoubtebly on lock down for this future roster.</p>

    <h3 class="draft-analysis">1.03 MixonMyBallsWithYourFace</h3>
      <h4 class="draft-pick">C.J. Stroud</h4>
        <p>This roster was one win away from another playoff birth... but was
        losing in the best intrest of this roster? This team has many holes to
        fill. Running back is without a doubt their strongest position so while
        at this pick Jahmyr Gibbs looks pretty fine, we have to stick with the
        QB position. With Andy Dalton and Jameis Winston's futures looking
        uncertain, MixonMyBallsWithYourFaces' hand is almost forced into Stroud.
        It will keep his recieving core a little weak headed into 2023's season
        but he still has pieces on his bench that could help bolster that need
        heading into the new year.

    <h3 class="draft-analysis">1.04 2027 Fantasy Champ</h3>
      <h4 class="draft-pick">Jahmyr Gibbs</h4>
        <p>Two picks in the top-4 can surely change the whole trajectory of a
           franchise. With Breece Hall coming off a major ACL injury and Mostert
           going into his age 31 season, along with Damien Harris becoming a
           free-agent; there's alot of uncertainty with that runningback's room.
          That's why Gibbs slides in here, projected to be a high day 2 NFL pick,
          Gibbs could easily have a path to RB2 numbers in his rookie season.
          Hall and Gibbs have the chance to be a lethal duo for the 2027 Fantasy
          Champion for many years to come.</p>

    <h3 class="draft-analysis">1.05 TRADE! Suk Yu, Suk Me sends 1.05 to Infinite
      Tsukuyomi for 2023 1.08 and 2024 2nd Rounder</h3>
      <h4 class="draft-pick">Jaxon Smith-Njigba</h4>
        <p> Infinite Tsukuyomi has been eyeing JSN for a year and a half now. And
          while he's been gun shy in the past to make the big move or trade, this
          makes too much sense. Why risk losing Smith-Njigba when you have the
          capital to move up. Infinite Tsukuyomi still holds the 1.09 to address
          his glaring need at RB or QB, but this move would give him the most
          lethal WR-trio in the league. Pairing JSN with Jefferson and Chase
          would leave the rest of the league shaking in their boots as the
          league moves to full PPR.</p>

    <h3 class="draft-analysis">1.06 2027 Fantasy Champ</h3>
      <h4 class="draft-pick">Jordan Addison</h4>
        <p>This is the last pick before a major tier-break for me so while the
          current recieving core for the 2027 Fantasy Champ is already strong,
          Addison will be a lineup lock for years to come. Addison is a little
          undersized but thats the formula that has been dominating at the NFL
          level. This man is so talented that he somehow leveled Kenny Pickett
          up to a 1st round NFL draft pick before he transferred to USC. Olave,
          ASB, Pittman, and Addison would have this team locked into the
          playoffs for many years</p>

    <h3 class="draft-analysis">1.07 Baker it Till you Make it</h3>
      <h4 class="draft-pick">Will Levis</h4>
      <p>QB for Baker it Till you Make it? Shocker! Whichever QB3 gets the most
        NFL draft capital is who I see being drafted here. There have been a
        wide range of reports so far on Levis, but if he is drafted in the top-10
        like many mocks have him, he will be a part of Baker it Till you Make it.
        Moving to Super-Flex has this managers mind in a pretzel and while he has
        many other glaring needs, his devotion to a bit trumps all. Just imagine
        a QB room of Watson, Pickett, Mayfield, and Levis. The rest of the league
        stands no chance.</p>

    <h3 class="draft-analysis">1.08 Suk Yu, Suk Me (via Trade)</h3>
      <h4 class="draft-pick">Sean Tucker</h4>
        <p>Suk Yu, Suk Me has a big hole at the RB position, having nearly all
          NFL backups on his squad it seems like the wise choice. Tucker has
          game breaking speed and many scoutes believe the combine is going to
          bolster is draft stock up into the second round. He dominated at Syracuse
          and will look to take that talent down to Suk Me and be a staple of the
          franchise.</p>

    <h3 class="draft-analysis">1.09 Infinite Tsukuyomi</h3>
      <h4 class="draft-pick">Zach Evans</h4>
        <p>Infinte Tsukuyomi will have a pre-draft decision to make. Waste yet
          another season of JJeff and Chase to sure up the QB room for the change
          to Superflex, or to risk it and go for it in 2023. I see him going for
          it and that why I beleive he takes a RB in this spot. He has been
          playing Russian Roulette with Akers, Gibson and Dillon all year so he
          needs to sure up that position. Coming out of Ole Miss Evans doesn't
          have much PPR value but at this spot and pre-combine he seems like the
          RB4 of the class.</p>

    <h3 class="draft-analysis">1.10 2027 Fantasy Champ</h3>
      <h4 class="draft-pick">Quentin Johnston</h4>
        <p>This pick was difficult for me because if previous selections are on
          point than a WR is not much of a need for the 2027 Fantasy Champ. His
          need would be RB but I dont see this wise manager reaching for a RB,
          especially when he has 4 more draft picks in future rounds. That's how
          we landed on Quentin Johnston. I think he's the best skilled postion
          player left on the board and essentially just a value pick at this
          spot.</p>

    <h3 class="draft-analysis">1.11 Griddy Merchant</h3>
      <h4 class="draft-pick">Anthony Richardson</h4>
        <p>If Anthony Richardson recieves high NFL draft capital he deserves to
          be a 1st round rookie pick and honeslty this might be to low. The upside
          Richardson has is Lamar-esque and while it will most likely be a "project"
          for NFL teams, that doesn'y mean Richardson won't have immediate fantasy
          value as soon as he gets his first NFL start.</p>

    <h3 class="draft-analysis">1.12 Pierce the Veil</h3>
      <h4 class="draft-pick">Tank Bigsby</h4>
        <p>After sneaking his way into the playoffs, Pierce the Viel is left with
          a late 1st rounder and alot of roster holes. I could see him going many
          different ways here but after trading away Nick Chubb during the season
          I see Bigsby as a chance at reloading the RB position. Pierce the Viel
          has let the league know his opinions on RB's in general, so drafting
          young a young RB instead of trading for an aging veteran is how I see
          him dealing with that position.</p>
